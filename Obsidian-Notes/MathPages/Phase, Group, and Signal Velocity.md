In the simple case of a pure traveling sinusoidal wave we can imagine a "rigid" profile being physically moved in the positive x direction with speed v as illustrated below.

Clearly the wave function depends on both time and position. ==**At any fixed instant of time, the function varies sinusoidally along the x axis, whereas at any fixed location on the x axis the function varies sinusoidally with time.**== 
$$
A(t,x) = A_0cos(kx-\omega t)
$$

where the "amplitude" $A_0$ is the maximum of the function.
One complete cycle of the wave can be associated with an "angular" displacement of 2Ï€ radians.
==**The angular frequency $\omega$  of a wave**== is the number of radians per unit time at a fixed position. 
==**the wave number k**== is the number of radians per unit distance at a fixed time.

 (We use the cosine function rather than the sine merely for convenience, the difference being only a matter of phase.) 
 The minus sign denotes the fact that if we hold t constant and increase $x$ we are moving "to the right" along the function, whereas if we focus on a fixed spatial location and allow time to increase, we are effectively moving "to the left" along the function (or rather, it is moving to the right and we are stationary).
