`QMutex` is a class in the Qt framework, which is a popular C++ framework for developing cross-platform applications. The name "QMutex" stands for "Qt Mutual Exclusion," and it is used to provide mutually exclusive access to shared resources or critical sections of code in a multi-threaded environment. Mutexes are essential for preventing data races and ensuring that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.

Here's a brief overview of how `QMutex` works:

1. **Locking and Unlocking:**
   - A mutex is typically used to protect a critical section of code. Before a thread enters this critical section, it must "lock" the mutex. If another thread has already locked the mutex, any attempt to lock it by another thread will cause the second thread to be blocked until the mutex is unlocked by the first thread.
   - The thread that successfully locks the mutex is then free to access the shared resource.

2. **Reentrant Mutex:**
   - Qt provides a reentrant version of the mutex, called `QMutex` (non-reentrant) and `QMutexLocker` (reentrant).
   - A reentrant mutex allows the same thread to lock the mutex multiple times, as long as it unlocks it the same number of times. This is useful in situations where a function may call other functions that also use the mutex.

3. **QMutexLocker:**
   - `QMutexLocker` is a convenience class provided by Qt that simplifies the use of mutexes. It automatically locks the mutex upon construction and unlocks it upon destruction. This helps in avoiding common mistakes like forgetting to unlock the mutex.

Here's a simple example:

```cpp
#include <QMutex>
#include <QThread>

// Shared resource
int sharedData = 0;

// Mutex to protect the shared resource
QMutex mutex;

void threadFunction() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i) {
        QMutexLocker locker(&mutex); // Automatically locks and unlocks the mutex

        // Access the shared resource
        ++sharedData;
    }
}

int main() {
    QThread thread1(threadFunction);
    QThread thread2(threadFunction);

    thread1.start();
    thread2.start();

    thread1.wait();
    thread2.wait();

    // At this point, both threads have completed their work
    qDebug() << "Final value of sharedData: " << sharedData;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, two threads increment a shared variable (`sharedData`) within a critical section protected by a mutex (`mutex`). The `QMutexLocker` is used to automatically lock and unlock the mutex, ensuring that the critical section is properly protected.

Remember to handle exceptions and use mutexes carefully to avoid deadlocks and ensure proper synchronization in your multi-threaded applications.
